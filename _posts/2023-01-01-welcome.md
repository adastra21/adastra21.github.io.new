Welcome to my blog :)

I will write about the underappreciated aspects of being a "data person".

I am currently passionate about product data science, and so plan to cover the following topics in January 2023:

- What (the heck) is Product Data Science?
- How to Prepare for a Product Analytics Interview (I,II,III)
- Why Most Startups Don't Need A/B/z Testing
